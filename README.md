# Girls On The Run

## Overview

This is my fouth milestone project for the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer course. It is a website to promote running to women. I feel that there are many barriers that stop women and girls from taking up exercise. I wanted to do someting positive that would empower women and give them confidence to git it a go.

The project has been built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django. It uses SQL databases to store information and Stripe to handle payments.

## User Experience

### Project Goals

This website is aimed at women and encouraging them to engage in running with the help and support of a running club designed around them. 

I wanted it to be able to build a like-minded, supportive and inclusive network of women. This will help them with achieving their exercise goals, making good friends and connecting with others in similar situations.

The project required that a user can create an account, log in and use that account to access their profile and to get extra member content. I achieved this with Django's useful features which quickly allow accounts to be created and tracked.

The project also needed an e-commerce element, using Stripe to control payment from users. I have set up an online shop selling branded merchandise. This allows users to browse, add to a shopping bag and purchase the items.
