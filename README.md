# Girls On The Run

## Overview

This is my fouth milestone project for the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer course. It is a website to promote running to women. I feel that there are many barriers that stop women and girls from taking up exercise. I wanted to do someting positive that would empower women and give them confidence to git it a go.

The project has been built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django. It uses SQL databases to store information and Stripe to handle payments.

## User Experience

### Project Goals

This website is aimed at women and encouraging them to engage in running with the help and support of a running club designed around them. 

I wanted it to be able to **build a like-minded, supportive and inclusive network of women.** This will help them with achieving their exercise goals, making good friends and connecting with others in similar situations.

The project required that a user can **create an account,** log in and use that account to access their profile and to get extra member content. I achieved this with **Django's** useful features which quickly allow accounts to be created and tracked.

The project also needed an **e-commerce** element, using **Stripe** to control payment from users. I have set up an online shop selling branded merchandise. This allows users to browse, add to a shopping bag and purchase the items.

## design
I wanted the webiste to have a friendly and welcoming feel, to make it appeal to a female market. The use of images or 'real' women and not just athletic ones, helps to make women feel more included and at home.

### Fonts
I've used the serif font [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?query=mer) in two weights, (300 and 900) with some **sophisticated letter spacing** to add to the airy feel. I like the no-nonsense clean lines of the font, and feel it suits the website perfectly. The 300 light weight contrast well with bold 900 weight.

### Colours
I created a **simple, complimentary, sophisticated colour scheme** that carries through the site. I simplified the colour palette down to just two colours for a clean and consistant feel. I wanted a strong grey to carry the main text with a bright turquoise to balance it out. The turquoise is a colour that appears on many women's sports wear items. I felt this would appeal to a wider audience than the standard and possibly patronising pink that might usually be used.
* ```Dark Grey: ##696969```
* ```Turquoise: ##3297a8```

* ![#696969](https://placehold.it/15/696969/000000?text=+) Dark Grey: #696969;
* ![#3297a8](https://placehold.it/15/3297a8/000000?text=+) Turquoise: #3297a8;

### Grid
I carried the **same basic grid through** the pages to add consistency and easy of navigation. A large **section header** quickly establishes the page you've landed on, and under that, is a panel holding the content for that page. A footer on each page hold **social media links.**

## Wireframes
I built my wireframes using **Balsamiq Wireframes**. This was a quick and easy way to work out the basic pages and element and how the would interact with each other. I then mocked up more detailed versions using **Adobe InDesign** to allow me to play with fonts, colours and images. The basic structure from my wireframes remained much the same, but colours, styling and some elements were adapted as I built the website and saw how it worked as a whole.
