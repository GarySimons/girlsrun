        Having a plan will help you figure out the best way to achieve your
        running goals. It will help you figure out where you are now, and
        importantly, where you want to get to. This will give you focus,
        motivations and provide you with an end goal to work towards.
        <br><br>
        We all have our own way of running. Some are natural heel-strikers,
        while others always lead with their toes. The good news is that one
        style isnâ€™t better than the other.
        <br><br>
        With a personal training plan, you will have access to the best advice
        and will be able to run better, faster, safer and for longer.
