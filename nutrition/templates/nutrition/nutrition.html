				Food is the fuel for our runs. The right kind of fuel will help in you
				run stronger and longer. The wrong fuel can slow you down or give you
				digestive problems.
			</p>
			<p class="page-text">
				Muscle cells have two main sources of fuel: sugar and fat. These come
				from the food we eat or from what’s stored in our own bodies.
			</p>
			<p class="subhead">Carbohydrates</p>
			<p class="page-text">
				Carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, a type of sugar, which
				circulates within the bloodstream and powers your cells. Any glucose
				that’s not immediately used is stored in your muscles and liver as
				another form of sugar, glycogen. When running, your body starts by using
				the sugar in your bloodstream, then uses the stored glycogen as glucose
				when that runs low.
			</p>
			<p class="subhead">Fats</p>
			<p class="page-text">
				Fat is the other material that feeds your muscles during exercise.
				Dietary fats must get broken down into fatty acids and other parts
				before the muscles can use them. This makes them less readily available
				than carbohydrates and less efficient as fuel.
			</p>
			<p class="page-text">
				Stored body fat on the other hand as even the slimmest of runners has a
				lot of it. As you run regularly your body adapts of become better at
				using that fat as fuel.
